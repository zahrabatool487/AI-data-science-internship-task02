## Task 2: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

Introduction

The Iris Flower Dataset is one of the most iconic datasets in pattern recognition and machine learning. Introduced in 1936 by Ronald Fisher, a British statistician and biologist, it has become a standard benchmark for classification algorithms and exploratory data analysis.

The dataset captures physical measurements of iris flowers and represents a classic problem in botanical taxonomy. Due to its simplicity and clarity, it serves as an ideal starting point for understanding core data science and machine learning concepts.

Problem Statement

Although the Iris dataset is relatively small, it presents meaningful analytical challenges that make it highly valuable for learning and experimentation:

Multi-class Classification
How can three closely related iris species be accurately distinguished using numerical features?

Feature Importance Analysis
Which measurements—sepal or petal—contribute most to species differentiation?

Pattern Recognition
What underlying relationships and structures exist within the data?

Data Quality Assessment
Are there outliers, anomalies, or inconsistencies that could impact analysis?

This project addresses these questions through systematic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization techniques.
